- [Individual Project](https://github.com/ceci-cast/PI-Food): This individual project called “FOOD” is based on building a web application consuming data from an external API using technologies such as React, Redux, Node, Express and Sequelize, this application comprises a home page, then a main page that will allow the user search for recipes, view recipe information, filter them, sort them alphabetically (ascending / descending) and a form to create new recipes, additionally includes two models in the database: one for the recipes and another for the type of diet, to To obtain the rest of the recipes from the external API, Node and Express were used, for the front-end development, React and Redux were used.
